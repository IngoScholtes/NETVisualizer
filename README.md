NETVisualizer
===

An OpenSource, OpenGL-based network and graph visualization framework for .NET 4.0 / Mono 2.10x and higher.

Main features
---

- Efficient rendering of large networks based on OpenGL and OpenTK
- Simple and clean network interface that does not impose constraints on how you implement networks in your code
- Simple to use in your own code, a single line of code is sufficient to fire up an OpenGL visualization and start exploring a network
- Easy-to-grasp interface for custom graph layouting algorithms
- Integrated multi-core aware Fruchterman-Reingold layout which makes use of all available cores
- Integrated frame grabbing capabilities that allow to produce high quality videos
- Full mouse control allows panning, zooming and selection of nodes
- Fully customizable coloring of background, nodes and edges 
- Node and edge sizes and colors can be conveniently and dynamically computed based on elegant lambda expression interface
- No external dependencies except OpenTK (libraries included) 
- Fully documented: Each method and field is explained and in-method comments help you to understand and extend the existing code
- Integrated, maximally demo that can be used as boilerplate code for your own project
- Platform-independent, built on OpenTK, runs on Windows, MacOS X and Linux
